# The energetic costs of the human connectome

This is the code and main data associated with the article of the human energetic costs of signaling (in submission process), by Gabriel Castrillon, Valentin Riedl et al 2023. In:

- `data` one can find the files needed to recreate the manuscript figures.
- `results` one can find the figures files from the manuscript created in the jupyter's notebook.
- `scripts` one can find the notebooks in *ipynb* and *md* formats.
- `src` one can find the functions created for this repository, which can be imported as a python module directly from any notebook: `import src.functions`.

The manuscript figures are already rendered in the notebook [scripts/Manuscript Figures.ipynb](https://github.com/NeuroenergeticsLab/energetic_costs/blob/main/scripts/Manuscript%20Figures.ipynb), but they can also be generated by running the notebook interactivelly in [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NeuroenergeticsLab/energetic_costs/HEAD?filepath=/scripts/Manuscript%20Figures.ipynb). To download the repository locally, just click in the button `<>Code` on the upper right part of this webpage or via command line/terminal:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/NeuroenergeticsLab/energetic_costs
```
All raw and processed data from the TUM-site are available in this online repository of [Openneuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004513).
